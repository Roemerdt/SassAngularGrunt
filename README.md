# SassAngularGrunt

A directory structure to quick start your AngularJS project with Sass, powered by Grunt

  - Grunt concatenates and minifies all of your javascript.
  - Grunt concatenates your SCSS into CSS, and then autoprefixes and minifies it for you.
  - AngularJS is ready to go, with controllers and views setup for you.
